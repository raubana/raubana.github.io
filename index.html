				<p>Hello.<br>
				<br>
				My name is Dylan J. Raub. I also go by "raubana" from time to time.<br>
				<br>
				I am a programmer, but I do a lot more than that.<br>
				<br>
				If you're new, I'd like to start you off with this video about
				a project of mine that has received some attention and praise.
				It should give you a good sense of what I'm all about.<br>
				<br>

				<br>
				Here's a secret video! This happens to be the first part of a
				video essay I'm working on that is very close to being
				finalized now. There's lots of <b>swearing and violence</b>, but
				it helps to demonstrate my editing skills and my appreciation
				for entertainment and the arts. It's also fun to watch.<br>
