			<h2>Details</h2>
			<div class="subsection">
				<p>
					This game is a set of standalone applications for hosting
					and playing Horrible People Games' fanmade cardgame called
					<a href="http://www.secretshipfic.com/" target="_blank">
						<i>Twilight Sparkle's Secret Shipfic Folder</i></a>
					- a card game for bronies - through the Internet. The set
					also includes a card editor for making custom cards for both
					personal use and for the standalone game.
				</p>
				<p>
					This project was originally intended to be used between
					friends, as the Tabletop Simulator and Vassal versions of
					the card game were a bit clunky and frustrating for us to
					use. After it was brought to the attention of the original
					creators of the card game,<a href="http://secretshipfic.tumblr.com/post/101186881656/raubanas-stand-alone-tsssf-game-is-coming-along">
					they gave my application praise and posted about it on their
					blog</a>. From there its popularity and demand grew outside
					of my circle of friends and into the MLP fandom.
				</p>
				<p>
					This project was a huge challenge. I had to design an entire
					GUI API from scratch, as Pygame (an SDL wrapper for Python)
					doesn't come with any. I have been called insane for having
					coded my own GUI API. This was also my first time using
					sockets and threads.
				</p>
				<p>
					As time went on, my interest in this project faded. The
					project is now abandon-ware.
