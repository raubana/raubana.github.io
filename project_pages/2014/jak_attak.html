				<p>
					A little over a year after graduating high school, I decided
					I wanted to make a game to sell online. This game, which I
					named Jak Attak, is a 2D top-down sandbox game that gives
					the player the ability to rewind and resume at any point in
					time they like.
				</p>
				<p>
					This game was based on another game of the same name I made 
					back in middle school using Flash. It was one of the first
					games - if not the very first game - I'd ever programmed,
					and it was interesting and fun despite its simplicity.
				</p>
				<p>
					This game was never finished and for a rather odd
					reason; I ran into a philosophical dilemma regarding what
					I believed to be true about free will, causality, and
					determinism. To many this seemed like over thinking, as I
					get to decide what solution I use in my game, but I couldn't
					help but feel like whatever solution I picked would be
					wrong.
				</p>
				<p>
					As it stands, the game is an interactive level editor with
					no saving or loading features.
