					<p>
						This game was made for the 2014 October Pyweek contest,
						which had the theme of "One Room." Pyweek has
						programmers make a game from scratch using <a 
						href="https://www.pygame.org"
						target="_blank">Pygame</a> (an SDL wrapper for python),
						and must be done completely within a weeks time. <a 
						href="https://pyweek.org/e/NEDungeon/"
						target="_blank">My submission</a> ranked 2nd out of 19
						individual entries.
					</p>
					<p>
						My game has the player facing against a living,
						talking dungeon that is angered by their presence.
						Knowing full well it could kill them whenever it wants,
						the dungeon toys with the player by creating holes in
						the floor, dropping in walls, and spawning aggressive
						monsters. In essence, the game is like a short boss
						battle.
					</p>
					<p>
						While not entirely innovative, original, or visually
						interesting, the game does have some interesting
						features - especially when considering how little time
						was given to contestants - such as scripted sequences,
						dynamic music, path finding, a tile transitioning
						system, and camera interpolation.
					</p>
					<p>
						A note about the misnomer:
					</p>
					<p>
						When you apply to take part in Pyweek, your project must
						be named in advance. As I hadn't yet started on my game,
						I simply used a temporary name - "The Never Ending
						Dungeon" - that I assumed I would later change. It
						turned out, however, that Pyweek projects couldn't be
						renamed (at least, as far as I could tell). This was
						obviously problematic, as my game is not "never ending",
						or even very long. Oops. If I could have renamed it, I
						would have called it something like "The Living Dungeon"
						instead.
