			<h2>Details</h2>
			<div class="subsection">
				<p>
					This game was made for the 2014 October Pyweek contest,
					which had the theme of "One Room." Pyweek has
					programmers make a game from scratch using <a 
					href="https://www.pygame.org"
					target="_blank">Pygame</a> (an SDL wrapper for python),
					and must be done completely within a weeks time. <a 
					href="https://pyweek.org/e/NEDungeon/"
					target="_blank">My submission</a> ranked 2nd out of 19
					individual entries.
				</p>
				<p>
					My game has the player facing against a living,
					talking dungeon that is angered by their presence.
					Knowing full well it could kill them whenever it wants,
					the dungeon toys with the player by creating holes in
					the floor, dropping in walls, and spawning aggressive
					monsters. In essence, the game is like a short boss
					battle.
				</p>
				<p>
					While not entirely innovative, original, or visually
					interesting, the game does have some interesting
					features - especially when considering how little time
					was given to contestants - such as scripted sequences,
					dynamic music, path finding, a tile transitioning
					system, and camera interpolation.
				</p>
				<p>
					A note about the misnomer:
				</p>
				<p>
					When you apply to take part in Pyweek, your project must
					be named in advance. As I hadn't yet started on my game,
					I simply used a temporary name - "The Never Ending
					Dungeon" - that I assumed I would later change. It
					turned out, however, that Pyweek projects couldn't be
					renamed (at least, as far as I could tell). This was
					obviously problematic, as my game is not "never ending",
					or even very long. Oops. If I could have renamed it, I
					would have called it something like "The Living Dungeon"
					instead.
