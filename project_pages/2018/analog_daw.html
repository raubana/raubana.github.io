				<p>
					Following the work done on the
					<a href="vectorscope_renderer.html"
					target="_blank">last project</a>, I started making tools
					for producing vectorscope music of my own. I made a
					Python script using an object-oriented approach by
					making modules (classes) that each performing a specific
					calculation. Altogether, it behaves similarly to modular
					audio-synthesis setups but with several advantages due
					to it being completely simulated.
				</p>
				<p>
					While Python is too slow to do anything complex on a
					standard personal computer, it did provide the means to
					successfully prototype the idea. In the script, I've
					set up and wired virtual analog modules which
					successfully produced sounds in real-time.
					
					You can hear the results of the setup shown in the image
					above by clicking
					<a href="../../misc/2018/analog_daw_test2.wav" target="_blank">
					here</a>, but be warned that <b>IT'S VERY LOUD!</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					If I ever continue on this project, I'll want to make
					the back-end in something much faster than Python.
					Maybe C or C++. As for the front-end, I want to take
					a more literal approach to this object-oriented system
					by making the GUI look similar to a synthesizer rack
					with fewer of the physical limitations that exist in
					reality. I made a vector concept of what the application
					might look like, which you can see at the top of this
					page.
