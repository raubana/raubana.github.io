					<p>
						Following the work done on the
						<a href="vectorscope_renderer.html"
						target="_blank">last project</a>, I started making tools
						for producing vectorscope music of my own. I made a
						Python script that behaves similarly to modular,
						audio-synthesis setups but with several advantages due
						to it being completely simulated.
					</p>
					<p>
						While Python is too slow to do anything complex on a
						standard personal computer, it did provide the means to
						successfully prototype the idea. In code, I have
						simulate setting up and wiring up analog modules, and
						I've been able to produce sounds in real-time.
					</p>
					<p>
						If I ever continue on this project, I'll want to make
						the back-end in something much faster than Python.
						Maybe C or C++. As for the front-end, I want to take
						a more literal approach to this object-oriented system
						by making the GUI look similar to a synthesizer rack
						with fewer of the physical limitations that exist in
						reality. I made a vector concept of what the application
						might look like, which you can see at the top of this
						page.
