				<h3>The Pancake Games</h3>
				<p>The Pancake Games was a hypothetical contest with the
					goal of bringing  programmers of all types of
					backgrounds and levels of experience together to compete
					in a friendly AI programming contest. The source code
					for the games would be supplied to all contestants. All
					together, the creative and competitive atmosphere would
					compel newer programmers to continue trying, plus
					cooperation between competitors and hobbyists, as well
					as the design of the scripting language, the source
					code, and the documentation, would theoretically teach
					newer programmers new concepts and good programming
					practices.
				</p>
				<p>
					The intent of the 2017 games would have been to have
					small teams of vehicular AI that would compete in a
					setting similar to the game <i>Rocket League</i>. The
					event would have been streamed and been a spectacle to
					behold, with commentary, overlays, and music.
				</p>
				<p>
					Sadly, this project was never finished.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Pancake Script</h3>
				<p>
					The Pancake scripting language is a high-level c-type
					language developed to be as straight-forward and as
					consistent as possible. In addition to Pancake Script,
					an Assembly-like language, called PC Code, was designed.
					Pancake Script can easily be compiled into PC Code with
					the included tokenizer and compiler, and is easily
					interpreted by program and user alike.
				</p>
				<p>
					A simple IDE was created that allowed programmers to
					program in the high-level language. It would show the
					compiled code, while an interpreter would emulate how it
					would execute in real-time, making clear what happens
					with the code behind the scenes.
				</p>
				<p>
					The interpreter would enforce extremely low "system
					limitations". For example, the stack would hold no more
					than 16 pointers. The purpose of the low limitations were to
					encourage smaller scripts - therefore less confusion -
					and more diverse and creative solutions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fun fact: it was because of the system having such a 
					short stack that the scripting language was given the
					name 'pancake'.
