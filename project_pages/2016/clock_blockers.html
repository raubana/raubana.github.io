					Ignoring the obvious wordplay, Clock Blockers is a
					two-player time-travel first-person shooter inspired
					by the <a 
					href="https://youtu.be/CBawCe6du3w"
					target="_blank">Corridor Digital video</a>
					of the same name. The game has the two players
					compete to obtain a malfunctioning time machine.
					Players will have to deal with time anomalies that
					make the same round repeat over and over, allowing
					them to play with and cooperate with their past
					selves. The first player (or is it team) to obtain
					the time machine 7 times wins the match.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					For me, this was a challenging gamemode to make for
					several reasons:
				</p>
				<br>
				<div style="padding-left: 1em">
					<p>
						First was figuring out how to both record the
						actions of a player and then replay them through
						a player bot. While difficult, it
						proved to be possible (although not without some
						small issues).
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Second was figuring out when a bot
						would be considered unlinked (whenever something
						in their time-line changes enough that their
						actions are no longer valid). The butterfly
						effect is very evident in this gamemode, as tiny
						changes are often enough to change the outcome
						of the entire round - like a domino effect.
						Making the bots too sensitive to changes made
						them  become unlinked too quickly, while not
						making them sensitive enough made them act
						strangely, like running at walls. Finding a 
						balance for each case was tricky, but eventually
						I devised a system that would evaluate bots for
						possibly being unlinked in a way that was
						considered acceptable to most players.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Last was that I had to create an AI
						system from scratch for the player bots, as they
						would become independent from their old
						time-line once unlinked. This meant wrapping the
						existing nav-mesh system and designing my own
						path-finding system. Also, player bots have to
						be controlled much like an actual player,
						meaning I had to design their code to work
						almost like I was managing a virtual keyboard
						and mouse, all while making them able to perform
						tasks, traverse terrain, and attempt to make
						accurate shots.
					</p>
				</div>
				<br>
				<p>
					I get asked about this gamemode pretty often. Many
					people want to play it, and while I want to release
					my code, it's still an experiment, and the source
					code for the project is quite messy. I simply don't
					feel comfortable sharing it at this time.
