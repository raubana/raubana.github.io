					<p>
						Ignoring the obvious wordplay, Clock Blockers is a
						two-player time-travel first-person shooter inspired by
						the <a 
						href="https://youtu.be/CBawCe6du3w"
						target="_blank">Corridor Digital video</a>
						of the same name. The game has the two players compete
						to obtain a malfunctioning time machine. Players will
						have to deal with time anomalies that make the same
						round repeat over and over, allowing them to play with
						and cooperate with their past selves. The first player
						(or is it team) to obtain the time machine 7 times wins
						the match.
					</p>
					<p>For me, this was a challenging gamemode to make for
						several reasons:
					</p>
					<div style="padding-left: 1em">
						<p>
							The first reason was figuring out how to
							both record the actions of a player and then replay
							them through a player bot. While difficult, it
							proved to be possible (although not without some
							small issues).
						</p>
						<p>
							The second reason was figuring out when a bot would
							be considered unlinked (whenever something in their
							time-line changes enough that their actions are no
							longer valid). The butterfly effect is very evident
							in this gamemode, as tiny changes are often enough
							to change the outcome of the entire round - like a
							domino effect. Making the bots too sensitive to
							changes made them  become unlinked too quickly,
							while not making them sensitive enough made them act
							strangely, like running at walls. Finding a balance
							for each case was tricky, but eventually I devised a
							system that would evaluate bots for possibly being
							unlinked and would do so in a way that was
							considered acceptable to most players.
						</p>
						<p>
							The third reason was that I had to create an AI
							system from scratch for the player bots, as they
							would become independent from their old time-line
							once unlinked. This meant wrapping the existing
							nav-mesh system and designing my own path-finding
							system. Also, player bots have to be controlled much
							like an actual player, meaning I had to design their
							code to work almost like I was managing a virtual
							keyboard and mouse, all while making them able to
							perform tasks, traverse terrain, and attempt to make
							accurate shots.
						</p>
					</div>
					<p>
						I get asked about this gamemode pretty often. Many
						people want to play it, and while I want to release my
						code, it's still an experiment, and the source code for
						the project is quite messy. I simply don't feel
						comfortable sharing it at this time. Sorry :/
