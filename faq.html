			<h1>FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
			<h2>General</h2>
			<div class="subsection">
				<p class="faq_q">Do you have any degrees?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">In 2017 I received an
				associates in The Science of Programming.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">What about certifications?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">Not yet.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">What is one of your biggest strengths?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I’m a perfectionist.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">What is one of your biggest weaknesses?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I’m a perfectionist.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">Are you a leader or a follower?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">Both! I’ll lead where I’m confident I can, and
				follow where I’m confident I should.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">How can we contact you?</p>
				<a class="faq_a" href="mailto:raubana@gmail.com">
				raubana@gmail.com</a>
				
				<p class="faq_q">Do you spend <i>all</i> of your time on
				computers?</p>
				<p class="faq_a" style="font-size:x-small">...maybe.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Programming</h2>
			<div class="subsection">
				<p class="faq_q">Do you know how to program in any language besides
				Python and Lua?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I have worked a little in C++, C#, Java,
				Javascript, Google App Script, Ruby, ActionScript, and VisualBasic,
				plus I’ve tinkered with BASIC and Assembly, but that’s about it. I
				can always learn, of course, and the internet is always a useful
				tool.</p>
							
				<p class="faq_q">How would you do FizzBuzz up to 100?</p>
	<pre class="code">for x in xrange(1,101):
	output = ""

	if x%3 == 0:
		output += "Fizz"
	if x%5 == 0:
		output += "Buzz"
		
	if not output:
		output = str(x)

	print output</pre>
				
				<p class="faq_q">Wait a minute... which version of Python do you
				use?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">You caught me. I only know Python 2. I still
				haven't got around to learning Python 3.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">How are you with version control?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I’ve worked a tiny bit with Git and SVN,
				but mostly Git. I'm still learning.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">Well, in that case, do you have a github?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">Y-yes, but I fear most of my code on there is a bit
				older and doesn’t have the level of polish I like in my projects
				these days.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">Have you ever worked on a team?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">Yes, a couple of times, although the few times I
				did we didn’t have a good systems analyst or designer leading the
				way, so those were pretty messy and stressful experiences.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">Tabs or Spaces?</p>
				<p class="faq_a"> I personally prefer tabs.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">Why don’t you do freelance work?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">Because it sucks.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">Do you make hacks?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">...No.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Office Life</h2>
			<div class="subsection">
				<p class="faq_q">How are you with Microsoft Office?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">Better than some, but mostly just okay. I do pride
				myself on good formatting and syntax, though. I'm most familiar with
				Word, Excel, and Powerpoint.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">Well, you know how to program. Can you do macros?
				</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I mean, I <i>can</i>, and I <i>have</i>, but now I
				know better. You wouldn't believe some of the malicious stuff you
				can do with macros.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">How are you with databases?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I’m not the right person to ask for dealing with
				databases. I’ve only ever done a little SQL, and it was for this one
				class in college.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">Do you make websites?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I can, but I’m inexperienced and the wrong person
				to ask. I mean, just look at <i>this</i> site.</p>
			</div>
				
			<h2>Entertainment</h2>
			<div class="subsection">
				<p class="faq_q">Do you have any games on Steam?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">Not yet.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">Aside from the Source Engine, do you ever work with
				any other game engines?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">Not yet. I’ve looked into Unity, but only just. I
				plan to look into more engines in the future.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">Do you make maps for games?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I have before, but I’m only okay at it.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">Do you make 3D models?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">Not really. I am pretty new to it.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">How are you at video editing?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I think I'm pretty decent.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">Do you make music?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I used to be very passionate about making
				electronic music. In fact, I have two demos that come with
				FL Studio, called <i>Cool Nights</i> and <i>LIFE</i>. However, I've
				been pretty burned out on music for a while. So, while I can make
				music, I don't do it much anymore.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">What about sound effects?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">Kind of, yeah! I like to record foley, and I can do
				a little bit of sound design.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">Can you sing?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">A little, yeah!</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">What about voice act?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I'm pretty okay at that.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Misc.</h2>
			<div class="subsection">
				<p class="faq_q">Are you a brony?</p>
				<p class="faq_a" style="color:black; font-family:arial; font-weight:bold; 
				font-size:xx-large; margin-top:-0.9em; margin-left:1.6em;
				margin-bottom:0.5em" alt="At least, not in the way most people think
				of them.">No.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">Are there any last comments you’d like to make?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I just love making stuff. I love art. I’ve always
				wanted to do something extraordinary, but until I’m employed and
				receiving a steady paycheck I can’t justify spending my time on
				anything not considered to be a “real job” anymore unless it helps
				me get there. Speaking of which, I hope this website was worth the
				effort and worth your time. Thanks for reading.</p>
