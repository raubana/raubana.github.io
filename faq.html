			<h1>FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
			<h2>General</h2>
			<div class="subsection">
				<p class="faq_q">Do you have any degrees?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">In 2017 I received an
				Associate's in The Applied Science of Programming. For a time I
				also went for a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, but
				that didn't work out. Left the university after a semester.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="faq_q">What about certifications?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I've done a handful of assessments on random
				job sites, but that's about it.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="faq_q">List your biggest strengths.</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I’m a perfectionist.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="faq_q">List your biggest weaknesses.</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I’m a perfectionist.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="faq_q">No, really.</p>
				<p class="faq_a">In terms of actual strengths and weaknesses, I
				have plenty of each. I am hesitant to list them, however. I'm
				sure you can understand, right? Let's get in contact first.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="faq_q">Are you a leader or a follower?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">Both! I’ll lead where I’m confident I can, and
				I'll follow where I’m confident I should.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="faq_q">How may we contact you?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I have <a href="mailto:raubana@gmail.com">
				raubana@gmail.com</a> but I rarely check it. If you're serious
				about possibly hiring me, then my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dylan-raub-b2b75795/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> 
				is better. I don't usually hand out my personal email, so if that doesn't work... I dunno... try facebook, twitter, youtube,
				steam, discord...?</p>
				<br>
				<p class="faq_q">Do you spend <i>all</i> of your time on
				computers?</p>
				<div class="faq_a">Nah, that'd be ridiculous...<p style="font-size:x-small">...just most of it.</p></div>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Programming</h2>
			<div class="subsection">
				<p class="faq_q">What are your strongest programming
				languages?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">Python first, and Lua second.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="faq_q">What do you know outside of those?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I have worked a little in C, C++, C#, Java,
				Javascript, Google App Script, Ruby, ActionScript, and
				VisualBasic, plus I’ve tinkered with BASIC and Assembly. I can
				always learn, of course, and the internet is always a useful
				tool.</p>
				<br>	
				<p class="faq_q">How would you do FizzBuzz up to 100?</p>
				<div class="faq_a">
	<pre class="code">for x in range(1,101):
	output = ""

	if x%3 == 0: output += "Fizz"
	if x%5 == 0: output += "Buzz"
		
	if not output: output = str(x)

	print(output)</pre>
				</div>
				<p class="faq_q">How are you with version control?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I’ve worked a bit with Git and a very small
				amount with SVN. I'm always learning.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="faq_q">Do you have a GitHub?</p>
				<p class="faq_a"><a href="https://github.com/raubana" target="_blank">Yeah!</a> As a matter of fact this website is
				hosted by them. That said, I don't know if you'll like what
				you find on my GitHub. It's up to you. Just try to keep an open mind, I guess.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="faq_q">Have you ever worked on a team?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">Yes, a few times, although those few times were
				pretty messy and stressful experiences. We didn’t have a good
				systems analyst or designer leading the way.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="faq_q">Tabs or Spaces?</p>
				<p class="faq_a"> I personally prefer tabs.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="faq_q">Do you freelance?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">Sometimes, but I'd rather be employed.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="faq_q">Do you make hacks?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">No. (Why do people keep asking this??)</p>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Office Life</h2>
			<div class="subsection">
				<p class="faq_q">How are you with Microsoft Office?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">Better than some, but mostly just okay. I'm
				most familiar with Word, Excel, and Powerpoint.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="faq_q">Do you make macros?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I mean, I <i>can</i>, and I <i>have</i>, but now I
				know better. You wouldn't believe some of the malicious stuff you
				can do with macros.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="faq_q">How are you with databases?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I’m not the right person to ask for dealing with
				databases. I’ve only ever done a little SQL, and it was for this one
				class in college.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="faq_q">Do you make websites?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I’m probably the wrong person to ask for making
				websites. I mean, just look at <i>this</i> site. I hand-coded
				this with Notepad++. I mean, it's not terrible, <i>but...</i></p>
			</div>
				
			<h2>Entertainment</h2>
			<div class="subsection">
				<p class="faq_q">Do you have any games on Steam?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">No, not yet. I want to be sure I have something
				worth publishing first (or that I'm prepared to make it), and
				I've got all the financial and legal stuff figured out. For now,
				I'm more interested in working for an existing studio so I can
				witness the process first-hand. Maybe I might try releasing some
				games of my own after I've done my part contributing to a few
				titles for other companies.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="faq_q">What game engines are you most familiar with?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">Source. I've done a little outside of it, but
				mostly just Source. I really want to check out Source 2 sometime.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="faq_q">Aside from those, have you worked with any
				other game engines?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">Not yet. I've messed with Unity a little, and I
				plan to check out Unreal soon.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="faq_q">Do you make maps for games?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I have before. I’m only okay at it, though.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="faq_q">Do you make 3D models?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">A little. I'm getting better with Blender,
				but I'm not amazing with it... yet.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="faq_q">How are you with graphical stuff?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I use GIMP for editing bitmaps and Inkscape for
				making vectors. I'm not amazing, but I know my way around these
				applications.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="faq_q">How are you at video editing?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I think I'm pretty decent.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="faq_q">What about VFX?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I... suppose it depends what you mean??</p>
				<br>
				<p class="faq_q">Do you make music?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I used to, yeah. My "lame claim to fame"
				has been that I have two original songs of mine that come
				with FL Studio as demo projects. My songs are <i>Cool Nights</i>
				and <i>LIFE</i>.<br>
				<br>
				I know <i>Cool Nights</i> was removed at some point, but I think you
				can still find <i>LIFE</i> in the latest versions, maybe? I'd
				imagine you could download the demo of the application right now
				and you'd probably find my project for LIFE in the "Demo songs"
				folder, but it's been a minute since I last checked.<br>
				<br>
				When it comes music, I've been pretty burned out for a little
				while now. I don't do much music stuff anymore... I mean, it's
				still pretty cool that I got my music into my favorite DAW, but
				there are problems when your music is just so freely out there
				like this. Not to mention that my music is just <i>okay</i>; it's
				nothing super special.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="faq_q">What about sound effects?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">Kind of, yeah! I like to record foley, and I can do
				a little bit of sound design.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="faq_q">Can you sing?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">A little, yeah! I practice a lot while I do
				idle work.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="faq_q">What about voice acting?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I'm okay at that, yeah.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Misc.</h2>
			<div class="subsection">
				<p class="faq_q">Are you a Brony/Furry?</p>
				<p class="faq_a" style="color:black; font-family:Rubik Mono One; font-weight:bold; 
				font-size:3em; margin-top:-0.8em; margin-left:0.8em;
				margin-bottom:0.0em; text-shadow: white 0px 0px 1em;" alt="I'm like... a lower-tier...?">NO</p>
				<br>
				<p class="faq_q">Are there any last comments you’d like to make?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I just love making stuff, especially
				entertaining things that make people go "wow!" I also love art.
				I’ve always wanted to do something extraordinary. I hope this
				website was worth the effort and worth your time. Thanks for
				reading.<br>
				<br>
				... please hire me ;-;</p>
