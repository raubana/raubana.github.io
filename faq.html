			<h1>FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
			<h2>General</h2>
			<div class="subsection">
				<p class="faq_q">Do you have any degrees?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">In 2017 I received an
				Associate's in The Applied Science of Programming. For a time I
				also went for a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, but
				that didn't work out. Left the university after a semester.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">What about certifications?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I've done a handful of assessments on random
				job sites, but that's about it.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">List your biggest strengths.</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I’m a perfectionist.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">List your biggest weaknesses.</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I’m a perfectionist.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">... No, really.</p>
				<p class="faq_a">In terms of actual strengths and weaknesses, I
				have plenty of each. I am hesitant to list them, however. I'm
				sure you can understand, right...? Maybe get in touch first.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">Are you a leader or a follower?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">Both! I’ll lead where I’m confident I can, and
				I'll follow where I’m confident I should.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">How may we contact you?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I have <a href="mailto:raubana@gmail.com">
				raubana@gmail.com</a> but I rarely check it. If you're serious
				about possibly hiring me, then my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dylan-raub-b2b75795/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> 
				is better. I don't usually hand out my personal email, so if that doesn't work... I dunno... try facebook, twitter, youtube,
				steam, discord...?</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">Do you spend <i>all</i> of your time on
				computers?</p>
				<div class="faq_a">Nah, that'd be ridiculous...<p style="font-size:x-small">...just most of it.</p></div>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Programming</h2>
			<div class="subsection">
				<p class="faq_q">What are your strongest programming
				languages?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">Python first, Lua second.</p>
			
				<p class="faq_q">What do you know outside of those?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I have worked a little in C, C++, C#, Java,
				Javascript, Google App Script, Ruby, ActionScript, and
				VisualBasic, plus I’ve tinkered with BASIC and Assembly. I can
				always learn, of course, and the internet is always a useful
				tool.</p>
							
				<p class="faq_q">How would you do FizzBuzz up to 100?</p>
	<pre class="code">for x in range(1,101):
	output = ""

	if x%3 == 0: output += "Fizz"
	if x%5 == 0: output += "Buzz"
		
	if not output: output = str(x)

	print(output)
	</pre>
				
				<p class="faq_q">How are you with version control?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I’ve worked a bit with Git and a very small
				amount with SVN. I'm always learning.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">Do you have a GitHub?</p>
				<p class="faq_a"><a href="https://github.com/raubana" target="_blank">Yeah!</a> As a matter of fact, this website is
				hosted by them. That said, I don't know if you'll like what
				you find on my GitHub. Up to you.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">Have you ever worked on a team?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">Yes, a few of times, although the few times 
				I did we didn’t have a good systems analyst or designer leading 
				the way, so those were pretty messy and stressful 
				experiences.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">Tabs or Spaces?</p>
				<p class="faq_a"> I personally prefer tabs.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">Do you do freelance work?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">Sometimes, but I'd rather be employed.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">Do you make hacks?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">No. (Why do people keep asking this??)</p>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Office Life</h2>
			<div class="subsection">
				<p class="faq_q">How are you with Microsoft Office?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">Better than some, but mostly just okay. I'm
				most familiar with Word, Excel, and Powerpoint.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">Do you make macros?
				</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I mean, I <i>can</i>, and I <i>have</i>, but now I
				know better. You wouldn't believe some of the malicious stuff you
				can do with macros.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">How are you with databases?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I’m not the right person to ask for dealing with
				databases. I’ve only ever done a little SQL, and it was for this one
				class in college.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">Do you make websites?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I’m probably the wrong person to ask for making
				websites. I mean, just look at <i>this</i> site. I hand-coded
				this with Notepad++.</p>
			</div>
				
			<h2>Entertainment</h2>
			<div class="subsection">
				<p class="faq_q">Do you have any games on Steam?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">No, not yet. I want to be sure I have something
				worth publishing and I've got all the legal stuff figured out
				first. I'm more interested in working for an existing studio so
				I can witness the process first-hand.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">What game engines are you most familiar with?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">Source. I've done a little outside of it, but
				mostly just Source. I really want to check out Source 2 sometime.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">Aside from those, have you worked with any
				other game engines?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">Not yet. I've messed with Unity a little, and I
				plan to check out Unreal soon.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">Do you make maps for games?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I have before. I’m only okay at it, though.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">Do you make 3D models?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">Not really. I've getting better with Blender,
				but I'm not amazing with it... yet.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">How are you at video editing?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I think I'm pretty decent.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">Do you make music?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I used to, yeah. One of my lame claims to fame
				has been that I have two demos come with FL Studio, called
				<i>Cool Nights</i> and <i>LIFE</i>. (I know <i>Cool Nights</i> 
				was eventually removed, but I think you can still find
				<i>LIFE</i> in the latest versions, maybe?) However, I've been
				pretty burned out on music for a while. I don't do it much
				anymore.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">What about sound effects?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">Kind of, yeah! I like to record foley, and I can do
				a little bit of sound design.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">Can you sing?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">A little, yeah! I practice a lot while I do
				idle work.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">What about voice acting?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I'm okay at that.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Misc.</h2>
			<div class="subsection">
				<p class="faq_q">Are you a Brony/Furry?</p>
				<p class="faq_a" style="color:black; font-family:arial; font-weight:bold; 
				font-size:xx-large; margin-top:-0.9em; margin-left:2.2em;
				margin-bottom:0.5em" alt="At least, not in the way most people think
				of them.">NO.</p>
				
				<p class="faq_q">Are there any last comments you’d like to make?</p>
				<p class="faq_a">I just love making stuff, especially
				entertaining things that make people go "wow!" I also love art.
				I’ve always wanted to do something extraordinary. I hope this
				website was worth the effort and worth your time. Thanks for
				reading.</p>
